CAPTURING DATA
1. Directory: final_event/trial_#
      run control.py and output the text file into the folder.
2. Filezilla the captured data over into jimmy_backproj/pulson440


PROCESSING CAPTURED DATA
1. Put the mocap csv, raw radar text file, and the 2 reflector csvs in one folder.

2. Run unpack.py on the raw radar text file.

3. Run parse_capture_data.py on the two reflector csvs, and the motion csvs and dump the pickle file to the same folder.
    FORMAT: python parse_capture_data.py [PATH TO MOTION CSV] [PATH TO PICKLE FILE(it will create the file)] [CAPTURE_TYPE]
      This will transform the motion capture csv into a pkl file.
      a) CAPTURE_TYPE is a string which the reflectors are labeled with in the csv
            default for real mocap is radar_group6
            the two reflectors are left_reflector and right_reflector

4. Run preprocess_data.py on the pickle files to compile the data into a master pickle file to be handed to the alignment code.
    FORMAT: preprocess_data.py [PATH TO FOLDER] [NAME OF RADAR PKL] [NAME OF MOCAP PKL] [NAME OF FIRST REFLECTOR MOCAP] [NAME OF SECOND REFLECTOR MOCAP]

5. Run align.py on the master pickle file to process it. There are a variety of modes, use -h to look.
