# BWSI 2019 UASSAR Team 6 Backprojection code

This is the 2019 team repository for BWSI's [UASSAR](https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/CMS/bw/bwsi_2018_course_-_%20unmanned_air_system%E2%80%93synthetic_aperture_radar) program. It implements a backprojection algorithm on radar data gathered from the PulsON440 sensor. The motion data of the sensor was captured with MIT's MoCap system. For the project, we mounted this radar on a drone. 

## Basic Usage

The main files are in backprojection/pulson440. Generally, you would unpack the data with unpack.py, align it with the MoCap data with align.py, then backproject it with backproject.py. Each of these programs have command line arguments, format accessible with -h. 

## Contributing

As we no longer have the equipment that the code was built for, we have no feasible way of acquiring new data. However, feel free to contribute if you wish, and pull requests will be reviewed by one of us at the soonest convenience. If you happen to be another student of the course from other years, please feel free to contact us.
